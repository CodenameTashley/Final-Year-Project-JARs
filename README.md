<h4>Categorising the .mu domain using MapReduce</h4>
<p>This project was created in order to complete my <b>BSc(Hons) Applied Computing</b> at the <a href="www.uom.ac.mu">University of Mauritius</a></p>
<p>The aim behind this project is to build a web crawler whose dataset is generated using multi-threaded programming and to crawl websites in the .mu domain.
After the crawling process is over, then the results are passed into Hadoop's MapReduce Algorithm which then categorises all the URLs based on their keywords or frequent (non-stop) words.
</p>
<p>This repository contains all the jars for the web crawler</p>
